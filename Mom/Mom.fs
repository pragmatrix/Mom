(*
    An Mom is a definition of an asynchronous process with the following properties:
    
    - can be paused and ended at any time.
    - can synchronously wait and respond to events.
    - can be combined in parallel or sequentially.
    - can send any number of requests to a host.
    - can be run in steps.
